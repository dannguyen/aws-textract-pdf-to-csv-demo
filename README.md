# How good is AWS Textract at extracting data tables from real-world PDFs

Testing AWS Textract's ability to extract data tables from real-world data PDFs (i.e. pdf-to-csv)


> **This is a work in progress** (and likely to be abandoned because I hate pdf work when it's for an actual job, and despite it even more as a hobby). I originally wanted to do a quick writeup of the new AWS Textract cloud service, and I thought I could write about how it did on a particular FBI data report [in just a single Github gist](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/3673e67a495c172abbd3bb8a9a6e199a). But I soon realized the number of files involved – e.g. screenshots, example PDFs, CSV output from multiple software solutions besides Textract – was really impractical for a Github gist, and much more manageable as a Github repo. So here you are.


Further down in this README,[ you'll see the raw data and my observations](#bookmark-intro-to-aws) on how Textract performed on the sample image file that Amazon provides (tl;dr: surprise surprise, it does a perfect job!). So far, I also have a [partial writeup and data on how Textract handles a PDF](./examples/fbi-nics/README-fbi-nics.md) from the FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (tl;dr: pretty good for how complicated the PDF is; unfortunately, it also makes a few serious and unpredictable errors in transcribing various data values):

I hope to test out Textract on some other well-known public and important PDFs:

### Example real-world PDFs (TK)

(todo)

- The [monthly reports generated by FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System](./examples/fbi-nics/README-fbi-nics.md) (difficult)
- California WARN notices (should be easy)
- Senate financial disclosures (as much of a clusterfuck as this problem can get; see [related repo using ABBYY FineReader](https://github.com/dannguyen/abbyy-finereader-ocr-senate))

## Intro to AWS Textract



**Amazon Textract** was [announced about 6 months ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18554122) but was made [public today (May 29)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-220000840.html). If have an AWS account, you can check out Textract's point-and-click demo, which allows you to upload an image or PDF for Textract to process with optical character recognition (OCR) and data table extraction. Obviously, the OCR ability is going to be a huge feature for many folks dealing with trying to extract data from scanned documents. However, Textract's capabilities in **data table extraction** is the focus of this gist)

You can access the demo via the AWS console at this URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/textract/home#/demo


### How Textract performs on its own sample document and data table


The Textract demo conveniently [provides an image file](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/textract-public-assets-us-east-1/default_document.png) – in PNG format – of a sample "Employment Application" document that you might create in a word processor and later save as a PDF. The sample doc also contains a simple data table titled, **"Previous Employment History"**.

I've saved a copy of the sample PNG to this repo:

<p style="text-align: center; margin: auto;">
    <a href="examples/default-sample-document/default_document.png">
    <img src="examples/default-sample-document/default_document.png" alt="">
</a>
</p>

It's worth emphasizing that while this sample *could* be a document PDF – i.e. a PDF containing actual text, rather than scanned images of a document – the demo seems to be operating on the PNG screenshot of the original PDF, which would require accurate OCR processing *before* attempting data table extraction. In other words, this demo shows the full purported value of AWS Textract for folks who hope for Amazon's solution to extracting data from **scanned** documents.

But given that this sample document PNG is supplied by Amazon, it shouldn't be a surprise Textract appears to OCR the image text *and* extract the data perfectly. First, here's a screenshot of what the demo interface looks like, including how it allows the user to preview the tabular extraction:

<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/textract/home#/demo">
    <img src="examples/default-sample-document/assets/images/textract-default-demo.png" alt="">
</a>

And here's what the extracted tabular data (i.e. [tables.csv](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document-zip/tables.csv)) looks like when opened in Excel:

<img src="examples/default-sample-document/assets/images/default_document-tables-csv-in-excel.png" alt="default_document-tables-csv-in-excel.png">

Basically, perfect!


TODO: More explanatory stuff and observations.


## The data files created by the Textract API

For your convenience, this repo contains the zip file that the Textract demo supplies as a download, and the individual data files extracted from that zip:

- [textract-results-default_document.zip](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document.zip): the zip file that the Textract demo serves as a download. In the zip file are 4 data files:
     - [apiResponse.json](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document-zip/apiResponse.json)
     - [keyValues.csv](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document-zip/keyValues.csv) (note: this file is empty)
     - [rawText.txt](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document-zip/rawText.txt)
     - [tables.csv](examples/default-sample-document/results/textract-results-default_document-zip/tables.csv)





## Why extracting data tables from PDFs is so hard

PDF is a great format for when you need a digital document that – unlike the vast majority of webpages and spreadsheets – will essentially look the same to anyone else who opens it on any computer, and/or wants to print it out on paper. PDFs, like Word documents, can contain not just standard prose, but data tables – such as copy-pasting from an Excel spreadsheet into Word, and then saving as PDF.

But for various technical reasons, extracting the data table from a PDF is often not as easy as copy-pasting from PDF into Excel. In fact, the metadata of the data's layout and structure is usually destroyed and irrecoverable when data tables are saved as PDF documents. It's a hard enough problem that it's one of the only situations in which I've given up on trying to hack it myself and settled for a commercial software package that is non-unscriptable (i.e. have to use by manual point-and-click): $99 for ABBYY FineReader – [which is *still* far-from-perfect but good enough](https://github.com/helloworlddata/white-house-salaries), all things considered.

Note: If you are interested in more technical details about on why extracting data tables from PDFs is so complicated, I highly recommend the following resources:

- [Heart of Nerd Darkness: Why Updating Dollars for Docs Was So Difficult](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/heart-of-nerd-darkness-why-dollars-for-docs-was-so-difficult), by ProPublica's Jeremy Merrill, which is an excellent and detailed overview of the PDF problem and how it applies to a real-world data investigation.
- [Introducing Tabula](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-tabula/), by the authors of the Knight Mozilla-supported [open source Tabula project](https://source.opennews.org/articles/introducing-tabula/), because PDF-to-CSV is really that huge of a data problem for journalists.
- [Introduction to The Camelot Project](https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/intro.html), excellent documentation and writeup by another open source PDF-to-CSV extraction library and tool, because PDF-to-CSV is a massive problem for everyone who works with documents and data
