# How good is AWS Textract at extracting data tables from real-world PDFs

Testing AWS Textract's ability to extract data tables from real-world data PDFs (i.e. pdf-to-csv)

I originally intended to do a quick writeup of AWS just-released Textract cloud service and thought I could do it [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/3673e67a495c172abbd3bb8a9a6e199a), but soon realized the number of files involved (screenshots, example PDFs, CSV output from multiple software solutions besides Textract) was going to be much more manageable as a Github repo than a gist. So here you are.
