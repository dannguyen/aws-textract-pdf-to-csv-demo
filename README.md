# How good is AWS Textract at extracting data tables from real-world PDFs

Testing AWS Textract's ability to extract data tables from real-world data PDFs (i.e. pdf-to-csv)

I originally intended to do a quick writeup of AWS just-released Textract cloud service and thought I could do it [as a gist](https://gist.github.com/dannguyen/3673e67a495c172abbd3bb8a9a6e199a), but soon realized the number of files involved (screenshots, example PDFs, CSV output from multiple software solutions besides Textract) was going to be much more manageable as a Github repo than a gist. So here you are.


## Example real-world PDFs

- The [FBI monthly reports generated by its National Instant Criminal Background Check System](./examples/fbi-nics/README-fbi-nics.md)


## Intro


**Amazon Textract** was [announced about 6 months ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18554122) but was made [public today (May 29)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aws-announces-general-availability-amazon-220000840.html). If have an AWS account, you can check out Textract's point-and-click demo, which allows you to upload an image or PDF for Textract to process with optical character recognition (OCR) and data table extraction. Obviously, the OCR ability is going to be a huge feature for many folks dealing with trying to extract data from scanned documents. However, Textract's capabilities in **data table extraction** is the focus of this gist)

You can access the demo via the AWS console at this URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/textract/home#/demo


The Textract default attractively and conveniently [features an image file](https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/textract-public-assets-us-east-1/default_document.png), in PNG format, of a sample document containing a simple data table; I've mirrored the PNG file here:

And surprise, surprise, Textract appears to extract the data perfectly from the sample image. Here's a screenshot of what the demo interface looks like, including how it allows you to preview the tabular extraction:

## File manifest for the Textract results

For your convenience, this repo contains the zip file that the Textract demo supplies as a download, and the individual data files extracted from that zip:

- [textract-results-default_document.zip](results/textract-results-default_document.zip): the zip file that the Textract demo serves as a download. In the zip file are 4 data files:
     - [apiResponse.json](results/textract-results-default_document-zip/apiResponse.json)
     - [keyValues.csv](results/textract-results-default_document-zip/keyValues.csv) (note: this file is empty)
     - [rawText.txt](results/textract-results-default_document-zip/rawText.txt)
     - [tables.csv](results/textract-results-default_document-zip/tables.csv)
